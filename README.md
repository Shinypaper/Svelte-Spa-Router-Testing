#  TESTING ISSUE

Adding the external svelte-spa-router breaks tests. 
If the router is removed test running the test works.


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start webpack:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.

Install then run tests
